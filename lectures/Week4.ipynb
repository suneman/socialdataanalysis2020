    ">\n",
    ">A couple of weeks ago (Part 4 of Week 2), we worked with spacial data by using color-intensity of shapefiles to show the counts of certain crimes within those individual areas. Today we look at studying geospatial data by plotting raw data points as well as heatmaps on top of actual maps.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * First start by plotting a map of San Francisco with a nice tight zoom. Simply use the command `folium.Map([lat, lon], zoom_start=13)`, where you'll have to look up San Francisco's longitude and latitude.\n",
    "> * Next, use the the coordinates for SF City Hall `37.77919, -122.41914` to indicate its location on the map with a nice, pop-up enabled maker. (In the screenshot below, I used the black & white Stamen tiles, because they look cool).\n",
    "> ![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdataanalysis2020/master/files/city_hall_2020.png)\n",
    "> * Now, let's plot some more data (no need for popups this time). Select a couple of months of data for `'DRUG/NARCOTIC'` and draw a little dot for each arrest for those two months. You could, for example, choose June-July 2016, but you can choose anything you like - the main concern is to not have too many points as this uses a lot of memory and makes Folium behave non-optimally. \n",
    "> We can call this a kind of visualization a *point scatter plot*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok. Time for a little break. Note that a nice thing about Folium is that you can zoom in and out of the maps.\n",

    "(*Fun fact*: I remembered the concentration of crime-counts discussed at the end of this exercise from when I did the course back in 2016. It popped up when I used a completely different framework for visualizing geodata called [`geoplotlib`](https://github.com/andrea-cuttone/geoplotlib). You can spot it if you go to that year's [lecture 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/suneman/socialdataanalysis2016/blob/master/lectures/Week3.ipynb), exercise 4.)"

    "We started the course by plotting simple histogram plots that showed a lot of cool patterns.
