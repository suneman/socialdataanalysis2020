    "## Before the intro: COVID-19 thoughts and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey All,\n",
    "\n",
    "So wow. It's a new reality. I made my [little video last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLjLCQQSzwk), but creating it on Monday night I was only a little bit early. The following Wednesday evening, the Danish government took pretty decisive action. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the whole, I agree with this course of action, and I encourage you to respect the government's guidelines. Practice social distancing. You know the deal. \n",
    "\n",
    "And let's me also draw a line to a recent excellent visualization. There's an absolutely amazing visualization in the Washington Post, which uses dataviz to illustrate why the social distancing is a useful strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\n",
    "\n",
    "And another really nice one from NYT about `#flattenthecurve`\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-trump-response.html\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you didn't see it the [3blue1brown video on exponential growth](https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg), that's also fantastic (as is pretty much everything from that guy).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway. I'm sure you guys have a lot to do this week, so we'll try to keep it relatively light (although there should be enough optional exercises to keep you all busy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that last week you worked with 2 different ways to classify data: *KNN*'s and *Decisions Trees*. We are going to continue working with Decision Trees and see how new information can influence the performance of our model in predicting which type of crime happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, crimes can have many causes, so we can combine datasouces to better understand what makes a criminal commit a crime. Are there specific factors which trigger that individual to act? Since criminals are notoriously shy about sharing information, we must try to find this out in a different way. Lucky for us, we can do this with data! *We are going to use weather data* from San Franciso to try to relate different crimes with meteorological conditions!\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll start with a relatively simple exercise focusing adding weather data to the decision tree from last week (Part 1, 2, and 3).\n",
    "* Then we'll prepare a bit for next week, when we get into the topic of explanatory data visualization with some lectures and reading (Part 4)\n",
    "* And finally, we'll have some advanced excercises if you can't get enough of the first exercise (Part 5).\n",

    "Before we begin adding new data, lets do somethings similar to last week and build a Decision Tree/Random Forest classifier to predict the category of a crime with the help of our friend `sklearn` using the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Hour of the week` (`1 , 2, ..., 168 `). \n",
    "* `PD District` (`TENDERLOIN`, etc).  (**Remember**, You'll need to encode this  labels as integers in `sklearn`, you can just assign numbers to the labels with something like sklearn's `Label Encoder` or do your own custom function). \n",
    "  * **Hint**: as we have discussed on Slack, instead of directly assigning a label to a number, you can encode your data using a *one hot encoding*. Essentially this is a way to avoid computers to establish a hierarchy/order between values of a certain variable when it does not exist, as is our case for PD District since its values are just names of Districts. Here's a [nice explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-encoding-using-label-encoding-and-one-hot-encoder-911ef77fb5bd) about the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will function as our baseline. Once we have it set up, we can use it to understand how adding variables from our weather dataset will influence the decisions of the tree later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will use weather data, let's try to think of crime categories that our intuition tells us might be strongly influenced by the weather conditions (type 1). And also think of other categories where we **don't** expect weather to play a role (type 2). We suggest:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BURGLARY or VEHICLE THEFT` for type 1. \n",
    "* `FORGERY/COUNTERFEITIN or FRAUD` for type 2. \n",

    "Feel free to explore other pairs that you find reasonable in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Exercise*: Build the decision tree!\n",
    "> * Remember to keep the data you used for training (since if you are following our recommendations it will be taken at random) so we can use it later on when we add the weather data (as was mentioned last week, build a **balanced training dataset**). We recommed you build a separate Pandas `Dataframe` with it, so the process of adding the weather data will be as smooth as possible later on. The same goes for your testing data.\n",
    "> * Create a function to evaluate the precision of your classifier. Make sure your test data is not used for training.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Additional ML-refinements (Optional):\n",
    "> * If you find yourself with extra time, come back to this exercise and tweak the variables you use to see if you can improve the accuracy of the tree. Try for example adding Year, Month or other variables you think may be relevant.\n",
    "> * Does one hot encoding affect your results? Compare the results you get with the different encoding techniques you use for PD District.\n",
    "> * Are your results tied to the specific training data you used? Are you overfitting? Try performing [cross-validation](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-in-machine-learning-72924a69872f) to answer this question."

Here's a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36292959/pandas-merge-data-frames-on-datetime-index) which may help you. \n",

    ">   * **Hint 0**: The output from the classifier can be thought of as a probability that *in some precinct at some time* we will observe either a crime of type 1 or type 2. Since the two probabilities sum to 1, we can map this to a [color gradient](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).  \n",
    ">   * **Hint 1**: You can use the method `predict_proba` from `sklearn` to output probabilities instead of classes from your decision tree classifier. This allows to use the map with a color gradient representing the probabilities of the crimes. \n",
    ">   *  **Hint 2**: Based on the data you feed to the Random Forest, you can use the average prediction of the all the datapoints you used for each specific district to create the visualization). \n",
    "> * Finally, create a GIF with all the maps you have drawn (from the 1st point) to display the entire week. To do so, first save each figure separatly and then load all the image and create a GIF. This can be done with `imageio` library in python. \n",
    ">   * **Hint 3**: Check out the following code to help with you (which assumes you've saved all files in a sub-directory called `Frames` with names `0.png`, `1.png`, ..., `167.png`, i.e. one frame per hour of the week)."
