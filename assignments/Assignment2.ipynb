(The reason I'm asking you to do the peer evaluations on the sunday is that I want you to be able to enjoy the easter break fully.)"

    "* What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.\n",

    "* Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).\n",

    "B) Also please answer the questions to my talk on [explanatory data visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHKYMGwefso)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the three key elements to keep in mind when you design an explanatory visualization?\n",
    "* In the video I talk about (1) *overview first*,  (2) *zoom and filter*,  (3) *details on demand*. \n",
    "  - Go online and find a visualization that follows these principles (don't use one from the video). \n",
    "  - Explain how it does achieves (1)-(3). It might be useful to use screenshots to illustrate your explanation.\n",
    "* Explain in your own words: How is explanatory data analysis different from exploratory data analysis?"

When you're done, you should be able to give the classifier a place and a time, and it should tell you which of the two  types of crime happened there.\n",

(You decide how to present your results, but here are some example topics to consider: Did you balance the training data? What are the pros/cons of balancing? Do you think your model is overfitting? Did you choose to do cross-validation? Which specific features did you end up using? Why? Which features (if any) did you one-hot encode? Why ... or why not?))\n",
